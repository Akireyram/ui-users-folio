# Change history for ui-users

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-users/tree/v0.0.1) (2017-04-07)

* First version to have a documented change-log.
* Handles `id` field, rather then `_id`, as unique key of patron groups. Enables this module to interoperate with new versions of mod-users (since commit 022b8b8c) but of course makes it unable to run against older versions.
